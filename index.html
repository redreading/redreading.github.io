  <p>This is an intro-level discussion group. Existing knowledge of Marxism is not requiredâ€”the only requirement 
    for members is interest in and openness to socialist theory! Meetings will start with a brief presentation, 
    followed by space for questions and structured discussion.</p>
  <p>Red Reading Club welcomes all comrades regardless of age, nationality, sexual orientation, or gender.
   Attendees must follow our Community Agreement: 
    <ol>
      <li>Respect each other as equals.</li>
      <li>Speak politely, honestly, and don't interrupt. Listen.</li>
      <li>Practice humility. Ask questions when you don't know.</li> 
      <li>Be open to criticism and self-criticism.</li>
      <li>Focus on the text, keep discussion grounded in the facts.</li>
      <li>Avoid subjective, one-sided opinions and personal arguments.</li>
      <li>Put the whole interest and collective learning before self-interest.</li>
  </ol></p>
  <p>Breaking the agreement may result in a warning. However, we have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination 
    or trolling of any kind. Harassment, personal attacks, domineering behavior, hijacking discussion, 
    attempted entryism (advocating for outside orgs), promotion of reactionary ideologies, or any other 
    such behavior will result in expulsion. No cops, politicians, or current military members.</p>
  <p>Red Reading Club is a new left-wing book club and social group based in Providence. 
    We are unaffiliated with any party or organization.</p>
  <marquee loop="infinite" scrollamount="4"><p>The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations... 
    no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas...  &#9733  
    The first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the 
    position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy... The proletariat will use its political 
    supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of 
    production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and 
    to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible...  When, in the course of development, 
    class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast 
    association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, 
    properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the 
    proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, 
    to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, 
    as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these 
    conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes 
    generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class... In place of the old 
    bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which 
    the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all... &#9733
