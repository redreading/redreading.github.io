  <marquee><p>The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations... 
    no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas...  &#9733  
    The first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the 
    position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy... The proletariat will use its political 
    supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of 
    production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and 
    to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible...  When, in the course of development, 
    class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast 
    association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, 
    properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the 
    proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, 
    to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, 
    as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these 
    conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes 
    generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class... In place of the old 
    bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which 
    the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all...     &#9733
