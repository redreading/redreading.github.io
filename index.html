  <p>Red Reading Club welcomes comrades of all ages, backgrounds, nationalities, sexual orientations, and genders.
    We have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination or trolling of any kind. This is an intro-level discussion 
    group. We do not expect members to have existing knowledge of Marxism—all that is required is an interest or 
    curiosity in socialist theory. Meetings will start with a brief presentation, followed by structured
    discussion and open space for questions.</p>
  <p>Attendees must agree to our basic Community Agreement: Respect and listen to each other, speak politely and 
    don't interrupt, never punch down, be humble and honest, challenge yourself and incorrect ideas, be open to 
    criticism, and put the interest of the group and the masses more broadly before self-interest. Harassment, 
    personal attacks, domineering behavior, hijacking discussion, ulterior motives, or attempted entryism 
    (promoting outside organizations) will result in immediate expulsion. No cops, politicians,
    or military.</p>
  <p>Red Reading Club is an independent book club and social group. It is unaffiliated with any 
    existing organization or party.</p>
  <marquee loop="infinite" scrollamount="3"><p>The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations... 
    no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas...  &#9733  
    The first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the 
    position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy... The proletariat will use its political 
    supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of 
    production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and 
    to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible...  When, in the course of development, 
    class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast 
    association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, 
    properly so called, is merely the organised power of one class for oppressing another. If the 
    proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, 
    to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, 
    as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these 
    conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes 
    generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class... In place of the old 
    bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which 
    the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all...     &#9733
